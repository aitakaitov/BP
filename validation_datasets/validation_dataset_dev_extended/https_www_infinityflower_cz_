Salabka Restaurant, Chateau Troja
A wedding at a castle. Hundreds of roses and hydrangeas were the bride’s dream come true.

 
 
 




Villa Richter, K & C Wedding
Elegance and luxury. This wedding was one of the top design this season. Floods of fragrant white large-flowered English roses, orchids, and hydrangeas were breathtaking. Combined with crystals and gold accessories, they created an absolute harmony of luxury and beauty.

 
 
 




Villa Richter, F & P Wedding

Olives and eucalyptus. How a refreshing design on a hot summer day! The leaves of eucalyptus scented the entire area of Villa Richter. Decorations on high vases were combined with lower, in the same style. And a little detail as a surprise to the engaged: they went to Greece for their honeymoon. And so we prepared them from plants that grow freely in Greece: eucalyptus, pistachios and olives. The whole wedding was delightful, cordial and sweet.
